ISSUES:

1.  When vsync was turned on, character's movement was
    independent of frame rate.  Now, character's movement
    depends on the value in line 385.
2.  Character's flag "flagGround" is switching repeatedly between
    True and False while on the ground.  This is causing its
    deceleration on the ground to be twice as slow as the acceleration.
3.  If character is jumping while the game is "hiccuping" (due to, say,
    an IM being received), character will jump incredibly high.  I feel
    this may be related to the dt value somehow.
