ISSUES:

1.  When vsync was turned on, character's movement was
    independent of frame rate.  Now, character's movement
    depends on the value in line 385.
2.  If character is jumping while the game is "hiccuping" (due to, say,
    an IM being received), character will jump incredibly high.  I feel
    this may be related to the dt value somehow.
